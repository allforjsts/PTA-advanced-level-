# PTA-advanced-level-

如果有对您有一些帮助,请给我一个星吧!作者正在和家里做斗争,如果写代码没有起色,可能真的就要做自己不喜欢的工作了,求求惹,磕头了,砰砰砰.

If my code add a little help,please give me a star//I am striving for providing for myself by coding,if that didn't work ,I will be forced to make a living by occupation that I don't like .please

I only have basic knowledge about algorithms and data structure at the time I am tring to pass PTA advanced level. 
I will leave as much note as I can to help noobs just like me able to get the point. 
Keep it sample and stupid,no tricks. 
For some of the query that I think tough,I may forge some test cases in code by notes.
关于数据结构和算法我只有基础的一些知识 我会留下尽可能多的注释来帮助理解 保持代码的简单好清晰
对于我自己做起来困难的题目,可能会自己制作一些测试集留在里面.
