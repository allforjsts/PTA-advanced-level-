# PTA-advanced-level-
I only have basic knowledge about algorithms and data structure at the time I am tring to pass PTA advanced level. 
I will leave as much note as I can to help noobs just like me able to get the point. 
Keep it sample and stupid,no tricks. 
For some of the query that I think tough,I may forge some test cases in code by notes.
关于数据结构和算法我只有基础的一些知识 我会留下尽可能多的注释来帮助理解 保持代码的简单好清晰
对于我自己做起来困难的题目,可能会自己制作一些测试集留在里面.
